Steam Link Hardware

The Steam Link allows you to stream games from the Steam Library on your PC to any TV in your home. The technology takes advantage of the horsepower you already have in your home, streaming from your current gaming computer by mirroring its experience to your TV.

Video and audio data is sent from your computer, while your controller input is sent back in real time. Virtually every game that your computer runs can be streamed with the Steam Link.



	Steam Link technology is also available for Android Devices, Samsung TVs, and Raspberry Pi


	Required/Recommended Equipment	
		
			A computer running Steam, Windows 7 or newer, Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) or newer, SteamOS, or Linux Ubuntu 12.04 or newer.
			A TV or display capable of running at 720p or 1080p resolution
			Home network connectivity to both Steam Link and host computer. Wired network strongly recommended.
			Any of the input devices listed below
		
	
	Supported Input/Controllers
		
			The Steam Controller
			The official Microsoft Xbox One Wired Controller
			The official Microsoft Xbox 360 Wired Controller
			The official Microsoft Xbox 360 Wireless Controller for Windows (with wireless receiver)
			Logitech Wireless Gamepad F310, F510, and F710
			Sony Dualshock 4 (wired or wirelessly using Bluetooth)
			Keyboard and mouse
		
		Please note: other input devices, such as wired PS3 controllers, may work with the Steam Link even if they aren’t officially supported.
	
	Getting Started
		
			Turn on your home PC, launch Steam, and log in.
			Power your Steam Link with the power adapter, plug in to a display device (HDMI), and connect to your home network. 
			Plug a controller, mouse, or keyboard into one of the USB ports on your Link. Follow the on-screen instructions to locate computers running Steam on your home network, then choose one and start streaming games to your TV!
			Once you’ve gotten everything running, you can pair the Steam Controller directly to the Link, without using a wireless USB receiver.
		
If you have questions about the app or need help using it, just click the appropriate tab.

			A Raspberry Pi 3B or 3B+ running Raspbian Stretch
		
	
	Supported Input/Controllers
		
			The Steam Controller (wired or using the included wireless dongle)
			The official Microsoft Xbox One Wired Controller
			The official Microsoft Xbox 360 Wired Controller
			The official Microsoft Xbox 360 Wireless Controller for Windows (with wireless receiver)
			Sony Dualshock 4 (wired or wirelessly using Bluetooth)
			Keyboard and mouse
		
	Please note: other input devices may work even if they aren’t officially supported.

	Getting Started
		
			Turn on your home PC, launch Steam, and log in.
			Ensure your Pi is connected to the same network as your host PC.
			Run the following in a terminal window to install:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install steamlink

			You can launch Steam Link from the Games menu, or run steamlink from a terminal window.

		<link>https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=6736-QEIG-8941</link>
		<description><![CDATA[The Steam Cloud allows games and the platform to utilize cloud storage hosted by Steam. Games can utilize Steam Cloud for storage of many different types of data, including game settings, save games, profile stats and other user-specific bits. Many Steam client settings are also saved via the cloud, including categories, friend nicknames and anything changed via the Steam client Settings menu. These settings will persist on an account regardless of which machine it is logged into, as the settings are pulled from the cloud upon login.

        How do I tell if a game uses Steam Cloud?
	How can I enable or disable The Steam Cloud?
	Where are cloud files stored locally?	
	Is there a log of Steam Cloud activity?

Issues & Troubleshooting
Because of the automated nature of cloud synchronization, Steam Support has a limited ability to address issues with the cloud. If any saves or other data have been lost, it is not likely that we will be able to recover them. It is for this reason that we encourage users to make sure they understand behaviors that can affect the cloud, so that when they are encountered, the loss of data can potentially be avoided.

        How do I resolve a Steam Cloud conflict?
	What if Steam is unable to sync files to the cloud?
	What if I lost a file or progress after moving to a different machine?
	What if I have an issue with cross-platform cloud data?
